				Hi there,
				<span class="text-secondary">Eliahu</span> here!
			</h2>
			<p>A few years ago I started to program in a self-taught way and I never thought that, to my almost 30 years then, I was going to find a hobby to devote myself with so much passion. This led me to study a Full Stack professional course at a renowned academy in Israel, as well as to buy/learn other courses on platforms like Udemy looking for the most complete training possible.</p>
			<p>I like to know that being a programmer is a career that is going to keep this hobby active all my life since all the time there are new technologies to learn.</p>
			<p>I am a person committed and always dedicated to his work and above all to his passion which I think is the key to success.</p>
			<p>I have had the opportunity to develop projects both alone and with a team. But without a doubt, the team is the best option. In a team one not only works but also learns and shares knowledge, something that for me is essential if you want a job well done and move forward.</p>
